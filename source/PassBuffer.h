/**
    An off-screen buffer for one stage of the chain.

    Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** Ensure() is called every frame and
    is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them; it reallocates when the
    host's raster changes -- and a reallocation CLEARS. The buckets hold the
    exposure so far, so on a resize they are not reallocated in place but
    resampled into a fresh buffer and swapped (see `--resize`).

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
    `FFGLFBO.cpp`). `Destroy()` deletes it first.

    **It owns its filtering**, because this plugin's buffers want different
    answers: the buckets are read texel for texel with `texelFetch` every
    frame, but on a resize each one is read BETWEEN texels by the resample
    pass, so they are bilinear; the exposure sum and the coating are data
    and must never be filtered. The Mipmapped mode is tinsel's and is unused
    here.

    Copied from tinsel, where it was written for a glow chain; the mechanism is
    unchanged.
