/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of the repos get a
    rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an FFGL effect gets
    only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- an effect is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it covers are the two failures that actually happen.

    **A shader that will not compile.** `InitGL` returns `FF_FAIL` and from
    the operator's side that looks like "the effect does nothing", with no
    message anywhere; with five passes this also records *which* one, which is
    the difference between a five-minute fix and an afternoon. The GL vendor
    and version strings go in next to it, because a shader that compiles on one
    machine and not on another is a driver answer, not a source answer.

    **A pass buffer that could not be allocated.** This plugin holds
    Buckets + 2 picture-sized R32F buffers (the ring, the exposure sum and
    the coating), and the failure mode when the driver says no is a black
    frame with nothing to explain it. What goes in the log is the size asked
    for, because at 4K with sixteen buckets that is about 570 MB of float
    texture, and the size the plugin settled on after every resize.
