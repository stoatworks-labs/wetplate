	There is no entry point to write. `plugMain` lives in the SDK, the host
	resolves it by name after dlopen, and everything past that follows from the
	`CFFGLPluginInfo` that Wetplate.cpp registers at static-initialisation
	time. This file exists so the bundle target has a source of its own, and
	it carries the one thing worth being able to read back out of a shipped
	binary: which build it is.
